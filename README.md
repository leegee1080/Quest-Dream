# Quest Dream

## A pipe dream game where the water is replaced by an adventurer.



### prog todo:
- [ ] create set of attack classes
- [ ] create set of defend classes
- [ ] boss room (gets its own class) just like battle room but with only one enemy and will drop boss level item)
- [ ] rest room (rest room will have random food just for art) (gets its own class)
- [ ] battle room func (complete redo, needs its own class)
   - [ ] enemies
      - [ ] enemies' turn (make the enemies's attack based on speed of a count down not wait on turn)
   - [ ] player's turn
      - [ ] redo to make the player class have one attack move and one def move
   - [ ] turn counter is random. speed doesn't matter any more unless an item changes it. turn is just an array
   - [ ] battle room drops 1 item	
- [ ] treasure room (gets its own class)
   - [ ] treasure room drops 1 item and player can come back for it (drops items from its own list)
   - [ ] items (the player can only have 5 items at a time) (items work like LOL items: increase stats, change the way attack/def moves work, change how the player character interacts with the map, change how enemies interact during attacks)

### art todo:
- [ ] art for attack damage telegraph, 3 skulls for 3 damage
- [ ] deco tiles to rooms
- [ ] change outer walls and the premade tiles to be spikes
- [ ] rest room
   - [ ] screen to level up stats
      - [ ] up arrows to perm raise stat of choice

Last redo!
- No items
- characters has unique attack and defence
- each battle room allows the player to upgrade character once, depending on character this could just be damage upgrade or something else (necro, summon more skell)
- Treasure rooms just give gold to unlock more characters
- rest room only refills health
